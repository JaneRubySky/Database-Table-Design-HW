> ***Note:*** _You can work together, but everyone must submit their own database diagram_

## Exercise

It's time to put your database design skills to work! Draw out a diagram of at least 3 database tables you would use in a banking app. The required tables are Accounts, Users, and Transactions. Think about the different pieces of data you would need to keep track of in each table and carefully select columns to represent those pieces of data.

#### Requirements

- Draw a diagram of at least 3 tables as described above
- Include table names, column names, and data type for each column
- Specify a *primary key* for each table (this could be a real-world value like social security number, but more often it is just an integer that is simply incremented as rows are added so that each row has a unique value)

**Bonus:**
- Add more tables
- Specify the relationships between tables (do they share any fields in common that you can use to link them together?)
- Indicate which columns are *foreign keys* (bonus because we haven't discussed this concept yet)

#### Deliverable

A pull request which includes a diagram, hand drawn or made on the computer. If you draw it by hand on paper or whiteboard, upload a photo to your repository. If you want to create it electronically, copy an image or PDF of your diagram to your repository.

#### Additional Resources

If you want to make your diagram on the computer (not required) try [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) and select "Entity Relation" from the menu on the left.
